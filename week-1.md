# Week 1 Review
* Fullstack Overview
    - Full stack refers to the entire depth of a system
        - Frontend + backend
    - Frontend: Refers to the visible part of the application on browsers / mobile devices, etc.
        - Built using HTML, CSS, JS
    - Backend: refers to servers, databases, and internal architecture that drives the application
        - Customer or end user usually never directly interacts with this realm directly
    - Fullstack developers are versed in both disciplines
        - Versatile enough to work on both frontend and backend
        - Organizations value fullstack developers since it's often necessary to have team members who understand how the entire system works together
* Operating Systems
    - Common OSes
        - Windows
        - Mac OS X
        - Linux
    - Kernel: program at the core of an OS
        - Has full control over hardware resources
        - Performs arbitration between different processes that are running
        - Provides abstraction between applications and the hardware
    - Process management
        - Process: an application in execution
            - Executed sequentially according to code instructions for that program
            - When a program is started, it becomes a process
            - 5 different states: Start, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated
    - Threads
        - A thread is a flow of execution within a process
        - A thread keeps track of all the instructions that need to be executed next
        - Also contains all of the current variables being worked with and the execution history (stack memory)
    - Scheduling
        - OS process manager is responsible for scheduling when each process gets execution time on the CPU
        - OS thread scheduler is responsible for scheduling when each thread within a process gets executed (for multi-threaded applications)
    - Memory Management
        - OS manages RAM
        - Processes are allocates space on RAM
        - OS also handles file IO (writing and reading from a disk)
* Unix Style commands
    - Unix is an old operating system on which many modern systems are built
        - Linux is inspired by Unix (although they're not the same thing)
    - Commands
        - pwd
            - current directory
        - ls
            - list files + directories
        - cd
            - change directory
        - mkdir
            - make new directory
        - touch
            - make new blank file
        - cat
            - output contents of file
        - echo
            - print to console arguments passed in
        - grep
            - search for string in file/string input
        - diff
            - compare differences between files
        - rm
            - remove file or directory
        - cp
            - copy file or directory
        - mv
            - move file or directory

# SDLC
* SDLC
    - Software development lifecycle
    - 6 core phases
        - Requirements phase
            - Defining what an application is supposed to do
            - Defining what resources are required for the project
        - Design phase
            - Modeling how an application will be put together
            - Architecture, UI, platform, programming paradigms, networking, security, databases
        - Implementation phase
            - Writing of code
            - Large project may be tackled by multiple teams
            - Version control system often used such as **Git**
        - Testing phase
            - Making sure an application is working correctly according to the requirements
            - Manual OR automated
            - Testing helps reduce # of bugs/glitches in application
        - Deployment phase
            - Application is made available to users
            - Manual or automated
            - DevOps is a modern process that is helpful for automation of deployment
            - Deployment can be complex if there are many different systems and/or distributed architecture, etc.
        - Maintenance phase
            - Users may discover bugs that weren't found during testing phase that the development team must fix
            - Additional features may be planned for future releases based on customer suggestion, etc.
* Waterfall
    - Classic method of development
    - Progress goes sequentially from one phase to another
        - Cannot go back to a previous phase
    - Phases are fully completed before moving to the next
    - Advantages
        - Simple model
        - Easy to implement
        - Phases are clearly defined
        - Works well in short projects
    - Disadvantages
        - Not ideal for complex projects
        - Time may be wasted since each phase needs to be completed before moving to the next
        - Software product is not available for testing until later phases, which means bugs may not be caught until late in the development process
* Agile
    - Revolves around putting customer needs first
    - Focuses strongly on user experience and customer input
        - Development is highly responsive to customer feedback
        - Software is released in iterations to respond to a changing market
        - Requires a strong team with excellent communication
    - 4 core values of Agile
        - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
        - Working software over comprehensive documentation
        - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        - Responding to change over following a plan
    - Advantages
        - Provides a responsive approach to development of software
        - Enhances flexiblity / agility
    - Disadvantages
        - If not implemented properly, inadequate documentation can hinder knowledge transfer to new members on the development team
        - Having a less rigid model compared to waterfall can lead to disorganization if team members are not good at self-organization
    - Agile user stories
        - Format
            - `As a <role>`
            - `I want <goal>`
            - `So that <benefit>`
        - Acceptance Criteria
            - Conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete in terms of functionality
        - Example user story:
            - As an account manager
            - I want a sales report of my account sent to my inbox daily
            - So that I can monitor the sales progress of my customer portfolio
            - Acceptance criteria:
                - The report is sent to my inbox daily
                - The report contains the following sales details: ...
                - The report is in csv format
        - Requirements are written from the perspective of the user to keep the development team in line with customer needs and wants
    - Agile standup meeting
        - 15 minute meeting
        - Occurs daily in the morning
        - Each team member talks about
            - What they worked on the previous day
            - What they will work on today
            - What issues/blockers/problems they are running into
