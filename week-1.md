# Week 1 Review
# Fullstack Overview
- Full stack refers to the entire depth of a system
    - Frontend + backend
- Frontend: Refers to the visible part of the application on browsers / mobile devices, etc.
    - Built using HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: refers to servers, databases, and internal architecture that drives the application
    - Customer or end user usually never directly interacts with this realm directly
- Fullstack developers are versed in both disciplines
    - Versatile enough to work on both frontend and backend
    - Organizations value fullstack developers since it's often necessary to have team members who understand how the entire system works together

# Operating Systems
- Common OSes
    - Windows
    - Mac OS X
    - Linux
- Kernel: program at the core of an OS
    - Has full control over hardware resources
    - Performs arbitration between different processes that are running
    - Provides abstraction between applications and the hardware
- Process management
    - Process: an application in execution
        - Executed sequentially according to code instructions for that program
        - When a program is started, it becomes a process
        - 5 different states: Start, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated
- Threads
    - A thread is a flow of execution within a process
    - A thread keeps track of all the instructions that need to be executed next
    - Also contains all of the current variables being worked with and the execution history (stack memory)
- Scheduling
    - OS process manager is responsible for scheduling when each process gets execution time on the CPU
    - OS thread scheduler is responsible for scheduling when each thread within a process gets executed (for multi-threaded applications)
- Memory Management
    - OS manages RAM
    - Processes are allocates space on RAM
    - OS also handles file IO (writing and reading from a disk)
* Unix Style commands
    - Unix is an old operating system on which many modern systems are built
        - Linux is inspired by Unix (although they're not the same thing)
    - Commands
        - pwd
            - current directory
        - ls
            - list files + directories
        - cd
            - change directory
        - mkdir
            - make new directory
        - touch
            - make new blank file
        - cat
            - output contents of file
        - echo
            - print to console arguments passed in
        - grep
            - search for string in file/string input
        - diff
            - compare differences between files
        - rm
            - remove file or directory
        - cp
            - copy file or directory
        - mv
            - move file or directory

# SDLC
* SDLC
    - Software development lifecycle
    - 6 core phases
        - Requirements phase
            - Defining what an application is supposed to do
            - Defining what resources are required for the project
        - Design phase
            - Modeling how an application will be put together
            - Architecture, UI, platform, programming paradigms, networking, security, databases
        - Implementation phase
            - Writing of code
            - Large project may be tackled by multiple teams
            - Version control system often used such as **Git**
        - Testing phase
            - Making sure an application is working correctly according to the requirements
            - Manual OR automated
            - Testing helps reduce # of bugs/glitches in application
        - Deployment phase
            - Application is made available to users
            - Manual or automated
            - DevOps is a modern process that is helpful for automation of deployment
            - Deployment can be complex if there are many different systems and/or distributed architecture, etc.
        - Maintenance phase
            - Users may discover bugs that weren't found during testing phase that the development team must fix
            - Additional features may be planned for future releases based on customer suggestion, etc.
* Waterfall
    - Classic method of development
    - Progress goes sequentially from one phase to another
        - Cannot go back to a previous phase
    - Phases are fully completed before moving to the next
    - Advantages
        - Simple model
        - Easy to implement
        - Phases are clearly defined
        - Works well in short projects
    - Disadvantages
        - Not ideal for complex projects
        - Time may be wasted since each phase needs to be completed before moving to the next
        - Software product is not available for testing until later phases, which means bugs may not be caught until late in the development process
* Agile
    - Revolves around putting customer needs first
    - Focuses strongly on user experience and customer input
        - Development is highly responsive to customer feedback
        - Software is released in iterations to respond to a changing market
        - Requires a strong team with excellent communication
    - 4 core values of Agile
        - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
        - Working software over comprehensive documentation
        - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        - Responding to change over following a plan
    - Advantages
        - Provides a responsive approach to development of software
        - Enhances flexiblity / agility
    - Disadvantages
        - If not implemented properly, inadequate documentation can hinder knowledge transfer to new members on the development team
        - Having a less rigid model compared to waterfall can lead to disorganization if team members are not good at self-organization
    - Agile user stories
        - Format
            - `As a <role>`
            - `I want <goal>`
            - `So that <benefit>`
        - Acceptance Criteria
            - Conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete in terms of functionality
        - Example user story:
            - As an account manager
            - I want a sales report of my account sent to my inbox daily
            - So that I can monitor the sales progress of my customer portfolio
            - Acceptance criteria:
                - The report is sent to my inbox daily
                - The report contains the following sales details: ...
                - The report is in csv format
        - Requirements are written from the perspective of the user to keep the development team in line with customer needs and wants
    - Agile standup meeting
        - 15 minute meeting
        - Occurs daily in the morning
        - Each team member talks about
            - What they worked on the previous day
            - What they will work on today
            - What issues/blockers/problems they are running into

# Git
- Version control system
    - Version control: the practice of tracking and managing code changes in a project
        - Save changes to project (creating new versions)
        - Revert to old versions of project
    - Version control systems are tools that facilitate the process of version control
    - Git is the most popular VCS
- Repository types
    - Local repository
        - Local copy on your computer
    - Remote repository
        - Copy that exists on a repository hosting website (such as Github, Gitlab, BitBucket, etc.)
- File states
    - Modified
        - A file has been changed, added, or deleted but the modification has not been staged
    - Staged
        - A modified file is ready to be committed
    - Committed
        - Staged files have been saved to the local repository
- Git commands
    - `git init` to create a new local repository
    - `git remote add` to link the local repository with a remote repository
    - `git clone` to create a local repository that is a copy of an already existing remote repository (ex. a repository that already exists on Github)
    - `git status` to view status of the repository and to see modified files and/or files ready to be committed
    - `git commit` to commit changes to local repository
    - `git log` to view newly created commit
    - `git push` to push commit to remote repository

# Java
- High level programming language
- Features
    - Highly object oriented
    - Strongly typed: values are not implicitly converted between types
    - Strictly typed: variables are declared with a type that cannot be changed
- Benefits
    - Write once run anywhere
    - Widely used w/ extensive 3rd party libraries + frameworks that are open source
    - Automatic memory management
- Disadvantages
    - Can be inefficient w/ memory management at times
    - All users must have a JRE installed on the computer to run Java programs
    - Forces OOP to be used
    - Takes time to compile code before it can be run
    - Licensing
- JDK v. JRE v. JVM
    - JDK: Java Development Kit
        - Contains a **compiler** that turns source code into byte code
        - DevTools, debugger, documentation tools, etc.
        - JRE
    - JRE: Java Runtime Environment
        - Built-in libraries
            - ex. String class, System class, Math class, collections API, etc.
        - JVM
    - JVM: Java Virtual Machine
        - Runs byte code and issues instructions to the machine on how to run the program
            - Contains a JIT (Just in Time) compiler that reads byte code line by line and issues low-level commands to the computer while program is running
* Primitive Types
    - 8 primitives
        - byte
            - 8 bit integer values
        - short
            - 16 bit integer values
        - char
            - 16 bit unicode characters
        - int
            - 32 bit integer values
        - long
            - 64 bit integer values
            - "L"
        - float
            - 32 bit floating point values
            - "f"
        - double
            - 64 bit floating point values
* Control Flow
    - If statement: used to execute a block of code if true
        - else if: is another if statement chained to a previous that will run if the previous was false
        - else: runs if if, and all else ifs are false
    - While loop
        - runs a block of code repeatedly while a specified condition is true
    - Do-while loop
        - runs a block of code first, and then evaluates a condition to see if it's true before looping again 
        - Do-while loops are guaranteed to run at least once
    - For loop
        - A loop with 3 parts
        - Declaration block: create a "counter" variable
        - Conditional block: runs loop if condition is true
        - Increment block: used to change the counter variable's value (could also be used for decrementing)
    - Switch statements
        - Use a specified variable and match its value against various "cases"
    - Break and continue
        - Used to exit a loop without further evaluation
        - Continue used to stop execution of current block and proceed to the next block
* Boolean expressions
    - `==` Check equality of two values
        - For primitive variables, checks whether values are equal
        - For reference variables, checks whether the two variables are pointing to the same object
    - `>` Greater than
    - `<` Less than
    - `>=` Greater than or equal to
    - `<=` Less than or equal to
    - `!` Reverse value of boolean
    - `&&` AND
        - true && true -> true
        - everything else is false
    - `||` OR
        - false || false -> false
        - everything else is true
